# Test Drive
The purpose of this Test Drive is to give you insight into what it is like to work with C2FO's engineering team. It also helps us to understand your work style a bit more. There are no trick questions or hidden agendas. The goal is to gain a mutual understanding of what it is like to work with each other.

We hope that you enjoy working on this project as much as we enjoyed creating it. We look forward to pairing with you to discuss your implementation. Meanwhile, if you have any questions or require more clarity, feel free to reach out to your C2FO Point of Contact.

## Getting Started
1. Review the requirements document that provides context on the features to be implemented [here](REQUIREMENTS.md).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Implement the functionality described in the Shape Up document on a feature branch.
4. Create a pull request against the main branch once the work is completed.
5. Tag `[REVIEWER]` as a reviewer on this PR.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
